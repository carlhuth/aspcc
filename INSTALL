Quick Version:

	$ tar xjvf aspcc-<version>.tar.bz2
	$ cd aspcc-<version>
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install
	# cp aspcc /var/www/cgi-bin/aspcc_cgi
	$ cp misc/htaccess /var/www/asproot/.htaccess

Long Version:

1)	'./configure'
	'./configure --help' will indicate parameters to
	compilation that you might want to set.

2)	'make'
	This will build ASPCC according to your ./configure instructions.

3)	'make install'
	Run this as root, or someone with permissions to the install dir.
	This should install aspcc and aspdoc to the place specified in 
	'./configure', usually /usr/local/bin

3)	If you want to plug ASPCC into Apache, there are a number of ways,
	and here is the easiest:

	*	Copy the aspcc executable (or the .opt executable) to
		some directory with CGI permissions and *rename* it
		aspcc_cgi

		Note to the technical: Sorry about this, but through current Apache
		configs I can't just pass a command line toggle to set it to
		CGI mode, so I inspect argv[0]

	*	In the parent directory of wherever you put your ASP code, copy 
		misc/htaccess to '.htaccess' file, editing it to reflect the correct
		path to your aspcc_cgi
