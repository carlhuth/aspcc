ASP CC (Converter/Compiler)
===========================

NOTE: This is an old and unmaintained project from years ago, before I knew
what I know now about language theory and implementation.
This README remains accurate, however. I would love to see this adopted by anyone
still working in ASP (are you out there?) who would like to add some speed,
type safety, and openness to their life.

ASPCC is a vbscript interpreter written on OCaml, extensible via OCaml, with
implementations for most vbscript functions and ASP objects.  It also has a
built in server-side include engine to mimic IIS's behavior.

Feature Summary:

 * All VbScript syntax supported
 * Most VbScript functions implemented
 * Most ASP intrinsic objects implemented
 * Extensible via Ocaml 
 * Includes documentation generator (like ocamldoc or javadoc)


Planned Features:

 * MSXML implementation (partially completed)
 * Class inheritance
 * Class "shared" functions - a primitive namespacing technique
 * ADO implementation
 * JIT compilation

Requirements
------------

ASPCC is written in [Objective Caml](http://www.ocaml.org),
a HOT (Higher-Order, Typed) programming language.

ASPCC's build process requires [findlib](http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages).

Various functionality depends on open source implementations:

 - `MS.XMLDOM` compatability will require PXP or gmetadome 
 - Date functions require ocamlnet for parsing.
 - In the future, session may use [PersiL](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~starynke/persil/) (right now there is no session).


Related work
------------

(and why ASPCC isn't any of them):

 - Asp2Php is a project with the same goals, but a different method.  ASPCC is
   a more traditionally structured compiler, rather than a lexical translator.
   Be sure to try both Asp2Php and ASPCC; one may translate more of your code
   base properly.

 - Arrowhead ASP Server is a java servlet that will allow you to run ASP code
   on many platforms.  This could help you transition your company away from
   ASP/IIS, but ASPCC intends to additionally provide a migration path away
   from ASP entirely to either PHP or an OCaml core. Another consideration is that
   at the time of this writing, there is no completely free implementation of
   Java.

 - Gnome basic supports ASP pages, on its own, and through mod_gb (outdated).
   The same rationale as for Arrowhead applies to GB.
