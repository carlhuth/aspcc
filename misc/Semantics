Tricky semantic points (and by "tricky" I mean "probably a bad idea but must be emulated")

x = 3
-----

The two ways to interpret this are:
	1)	If x is an object, and has a default property then apply its 'let' procedure to [3]
	2)	Otherwise x is a normal variable and is assigned directly


x(4) = "hello"
--------------

Again,
	1)	If x is an object, and has a default property, apply it's 'let' procedure to [4; "hello"]
	2)	Otherwise, x must be an array, and we assign the 4th field

Date
----

Here is how COM, and thus vbScript, represent dates... we will copy them, or
at least behave correctly when dates are used in math:

A date is stored as a double precision value which is days since
30 December 1899
